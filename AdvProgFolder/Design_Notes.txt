Source structure: 
-------------------------
- MVC: model-view-controller (recommended for java type)
    Model:      Data
    View:       GUI components (swing)
    Controller: Run program, control objects

Program structure concept:
--------------------------
- Main class
- Static class for handling creation and as-a-whole interrogation of database 
- Static class for importing csv into database
- Classes for representing access to, and forms of the data, in the database i.e. DAO
- Classes and resources with SQL create statement and queries
- Swing extensions/implementations for custom swing components

Swing structure:
----------------
- First Dialog (splash screen)
- Main Frame (table view)
    - Flight Panel
        - Default 
        - Full search sub-panel
    - Airport Panel
    - Airline Panel Basic
    - Airline Panel Analysis
    - Delay Reason Pie chart

Notes:
------
- Spec mentioned graphs. Developer is severely colour blind and avoids graphical representation as much as possible, preferring tables and data. However deep analysis and complex search restrictions on the database are performed (see Airport analysis tab) 
- No custom exceptions. 
- Could be made wholly object oriented but not necessary for the function type of the static classes.
- Silent exceptions were seen to propagate with no functionality pickup during dev (i.e. unexpected), endeavoured to fix.
